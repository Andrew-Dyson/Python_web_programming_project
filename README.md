## Create a web app to allow a nursery to manage details about the children they care for - inspired by vet management brief

MVP - CRUD app
- Register child (create) with name, date of birth, contact details, allergies
- Register parent with name, children, contact details, payment details
- Assign child to nursery room
- Assign child to key worker
- Access (read) a childs information
- Update a childs information
- Delete a child and parent when they leave the nursery

Extensions
- Calculate monthly fees/billing based on days the child is at the nursery, apply discounts if multiple children
- If a parent has multiple children we don't want to keep updating contact details separately for each child. Extend the application to reflect that a parent can have many children and to more sensibly keep track of parent's details (avoiding repetition / inconsistencies)
- Create appointments with key worker
- Allow workers to give daily updates to parents about their child eg. nap times, food eaten, nappies
